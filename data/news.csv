a7ed74f2-4f82-33c9-b645-cfe580ab63da;AAPL;Zuckerberg, Pichai Said to Be Open to Testifying to Congress;(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai are willing to testify before a congressional panel investigating competition issues in the technology industry, according to two people familiar with the matter.Apple Inc. hasn’t guaranteed it would make Tim Cook available to the House antitrust panel, said the people, who asked not to be named describing the talks. Amazon.com Inc. has already said it would send Jeff Bezos to testify “at a hearing with the other CEOs this summer.” That would mark Bezos’ first appearance before Congress.The commitments to send Zuckerberg and Pichai, which the companies have relayed to the panel, were conditioned on appearances by the other CEOs, the people said.Spokespeople for the companies either declined to comment or didn’t respond to requests. A spokesman for Representative David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat leading the probe, declined to comment.The Washington Post reported earlier on the willingness of Zuckerberg and Pichai, who is also CEO of Alphabet’s Google unit, to testify.Apple’s position -- that it will send an appropriate executive, without promising Cook -- mirrors Amazon’s earlier reluctance to send its chief and could provoke a clash between the company and the lawmakers taking part in the probe. In Amazon’s case, Cicilline repeatedly threatened to subpoena Bezos, although the company ultimately backed down and agreed to send him voluntarily.Cicilline may want to hear from the CEOs soon: He has said he wants to include their testimony in a final report that would propose changes to antitrust law. He has said the investigation and report are close to being finished.William Kovacic, a professor of competition law at George Washington University Law School, said Cicilline wants a live hearing with testimony from all four CEOs to build public support for stepped-up legislative oversight of tech companies and to pressure the antitrust agencies to pursue aggressive lawsuits or investigations. The goal is “to goad the enforcement agencies,” Kovacic said in a recent interview.Antitrust scrutiny of giant technology companies is accelerating. Facebook and Google both face competition probes by federal enforcers and nearly all 50 states. Amazon is under investigation in California, Bloomberg has reported, and both the e-commerce giant and Apple are facing scrutiny in the EU.Last September, Cicilline’s subcommittee sent extensive document requests to the four companies seeking detailed information about acquisitions, business practices, executive communications, previous probes and lawsuits.Unlike Bezos, the other CEOs have been questioned at Congressional hearings before. Zuckerberg testified after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which Facebook allowed the harvesting of personal data of millions of users without their permission in 2018, and about the company’s digital currency, Libra, the following year. Pichai also testified in 2018 on allegations that the company is politically biased in its treatment of content. Tim Cook testified in 2013 about the company’s payment of taxes.(Updates with potential timing of hearing and other details from seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.;Tue, 16 Jun 2020 21:57:28 +0000;AAPL_2020-06-16;-0.2172;0.0

5bcf6afd-fc77-3646-a0be-a2bd869f66ed;AAPL;Apple Deserves the EU Antitrust Scrutiny It's Getting;(Bloomberg Opinion) -- And it begins. Apple Inc. now officially faces a double threat on the regulatory front.On Tuesday, the European Union announced it has opened two formal antitrust investigations into the tech giant to see if the company has broken competition laws with its App Store and Apple Pay services. Specifically, the regulators plan to investigate Apple’s rules surrounding its in-app purchase system, where its charge developers a 30% cut for digital content or services sold on its platform (the 30% fee is lowered to 15% after the first year for subscriptions), along with the company’s restrictions on developers from informing users of alternative purchasing avenues inside their iOS apps. The EU will also look into how Apple Pay is the only payment solution allowed to use Apple mobile devices’ “tap and go” payment functionality inside physical stores.Of the two, the potential regulation of the App Store is the bigger deal. For years, the digital store’s excessive fee structure has been a main point of contention for app developers. Epic Games Inc. CEO Tim Sweeney has repeatedly said the commission rate was too high given the actual middle-man services Apple provides. Further, in 2019 music-streaming company Spotify Technology SA filed a complaint with the EU, citing Apple’s fees and restrictive rules, which the regulator has now cited as an impetus for the formal investigation. The detractors have a point — the Apple App Store has attained excessive power in the marketplace. Companies have no choice but to accept Apple’s terms to get access to the more than 1.5 billion iOS devices in active use and the 500 million people who use the App Store on a weekly basis. Antitrust laws were designed to ensure vigorous competition and protect consumers from harmful anti-competitive business practices. And the Apple App Store’s onerous practices fit that bill.Apple has long argued the App Store has spurred a wave of innovation over the last decade and allowed startups to scale their customer bases rapidly with its “safe, secure” platform. But the company’s user base has grown so large and is too dominant in the market. Outside of Google’s Android there is little to no competition in the smartphone space to reach such a large audience. Apple also has hurt its standing by relaxing its App Store rules for certain large companies. In April, Bloomberg News reported that the company allowed a handful “premium subscription video” providers — including Amazon.com Inc., Vivendi SA, and Altice USA Inc.’s Altice One — the ability to charge consumers directly using their own payment systems without paying a commission to Apple.Unfortunately, not all companies have the negotiation leverage of Amazon. Regulators should stand up for the smaller companies that frankly need the fee break more.  Moreover, the EU should at least mandate Apple to allow developers to inform users they can purchase content outside the app.At the end of the day, a lower App Store commission rate wouldn’t be the end of the world for Apple. For all the talk about the company’s strategic shift to services, the segment, of which the App Store is only a part, accounted for just 18% of its sales in its most recent fiscal year. But a 50% reduction, for example, would be a tremendous boon for smaller companies — spurring more innovation and lower prices for consumers. That’s an end result regulators should fight for.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

3413d637-6b5b-3c5e-be8d-b8452f2b93f0;AAPL;Apple Probes Show Vestager Is Seeking to Smash Big Tech’s Rules;(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. faces a set of probes from Margrethe Vestager that show the European Union’s powerful antitrust chief is trying to rewrite big tech’s rulebooks.Apple’s “gatekeeper” position for apps and payments makes it the latest target for the Dane, who is also planning to escalate a probe into Amazon.com Inc.’s role in online retail. Regulators “need to ensure that Apple’s rules do not distort competition” where it competes with rival apps for music streaming or books.When the 52-year-old Vestager received an unprecedented second-term as the EU’s antitrust enforcer last year, she was determined to avoid lengthy probes that levied fines but failed to crack the power of online giants. Google has largely shrugged off some $9 billion in fines and antitrust orders that tried to stoke more competition for search services.Aitor Ortiz, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said that the massive penalties in the Google case weren’t successful.“This is not about the fines,” Ortiz said. “We saw it with Google, the fines don’t really have a deterrent effect.”The EU will review whether Apple’s app store violates competition law by forcing software makers to use its own in-app payment system that typically takes a 30% cut of subscription fees. It will check if Apple unfairly curbs developers from telling users about other, cheaper payment methods. And it will also investigate whether Apple unfairly blocks other providers from using tap-and-go functionality on iPhones.Just four years after hitting Apple with a record 13 billion-euro ($14.7 billion) tax bill, Vestager is pivoting to the company’s business behavior. It’s the latest in a growing list of EU probes into Silicon Valley, which have led to criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and complaints about how tighter EU regulation is trying to tie down American companies.The case is likely to be “big, complex and sophisticated” as the EU seeks to test new ideas on how some firms play a gatekeeper role for entire industries, said Nicolas Petit, a law professor at the University of Liege.Apple said that the EU is responding to complaints from rivals that “simply want a free ride, and don’t want to play by the same rules as everyone else.”“It’s disappointing the European Commission is advancing baseless complaints from a handful of companies,” Apple said in a statement. “At the end of the day, our goal is simple: for our customers to have access to the best app or service of their choice, in a safe and secure environment.”Shares of Cupertino, California-based Apple rose 1.6% to $348.59 in New York trading Tuesday morning. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has previously called Vestager’s decision in the tax case “political crap” in a longer battle over how digital giants should be taxed in Europe.Spotify Technology SA last year complained that Apple unfairly squeezes its music streaming service with ever-changing rules and a large cut of sales on the app store. Spotify said the EU investigations made it “a good day for consumers.”Apple Keeps Payments Tech for Itself and Europe Has Had EnoughThe latest EU probes target a strategic area for company, which has gradually shifted focus from hardware to subscription-based services like Apple TV and Apple Music in search for other revenue streams. For the 2019 fiscal year ending September 28, 2019, revenues for Apple’s services grew 16% to $46.3 billion but they but they were still a fraction of its overall sales of $260.2 billion.EU scrutiny of Apple’s businesses could widen. Regulators continue to look at parental control apps as well as gaming apps.Ultimately, the EU may seek to give breathing space to companies facing pressure from tech giants as they expand into new areas, he said.“The long game of European competition enforcers is to leave enough economic value on the table for smaller players” such as online merchants, app makers and news publishers, Petit said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.;Tue, 16 Jun 2020 16:04:08 +0000;AAPL_2020-06-16;0.9409;0.0

6391a385-2209-3340-970e-372832ead72d;AAPL;Bahrain, Kuwait Virus Apps Endanger Privacy, Amnesty Says;(Bloomberg) -- Contact-tracing apps rolled out by Bahrain, Kuwait and Norway to track the spread of the coronavirus have endangered the privacy and security of hundreds of thousands of people by marking users’ locations in real time, human rights group Amnesty International said.Bahrain’s “BeAware Bahrain”, Kuwait’s “Shlonik” and Norway’s “Smittestopp” apps stood out as some of “the most alarming mass surveillance tools” in an analysis of 11 apps across Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the group said. The survey was carried out by Amnesty’s Security Lab, which conducts technical investigations into cyber-attacks against civil society.The three apps frequently capture users’ GPS location data and upload it to a central government database, effectively tracking users’ movements as they happen, Amnesty said. The location information can be easily linked to an individual given that users are required to sign up to the app with a national ID number in Bahrain and Kuwait and with a valid phone number in Norway.“Bahrain, Kuwait and Norway are running roughshod over people’s privacy, with highly invasive surveillance tools which go far beyond what is justified in efforts to tackle Covid-19,” said Claudio Guarnieri, head of Amnesty International’s Security Lab. “These governments must immediately halt the use of such intrusive apps in their current form.”A representative Kuwait didn’t immediately comment late Monday. Amnesty said it notified authorities in the three countries of its findings ahead of publication of the report.“The ‘BeAware’ app was designed for the sole purpose of advancing contact tracing efforts and saving lives,” a Bahraini government spokesperson said. “It is an entirely voluntary opt-in app, available free of charge on iOS and Android, and all users are informed of its use of GPS software before downloading.”Bahrain said that users who aren’t under quarantine or mandatory self-isolation orders can turn off the GPS feature of the app, which it said has contributed to a low death rate from the virus.Norway“Downloading the app is completely voluntary. Many people download apps that store sensitive information centrally and that’s used for commercial purposes,” Norway’s Health Minister Bent Hoie said in an email. “‘Smittestopp’ is an app that’s used and owned by society to fight a pandemic.”Hoie had responded to Amnesty in a letter dated June 12 defending the app, which he said followed the European General Data Protection Regulation as well as local privacy-protection rules and was crucial in fighting the spread of Covid-19 and preventing a longer lockdown.Still, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health on Monday had already halted the use of its mobile phone tool and deleted all the data it had collected after the country’s data protection authority warned it would temporarily ban the processing of personal information associated with the app.The Norwegian watchdog also questioned how useful the app is given its low usage and also warned that pairing Bluetooth technology for contact detection with location data for analysis went too far.Hoie said in the letter that the public health authorities were investigating some of the issues that Amnesty had brought up and had reduced the amount of time data would be stored to 10 days from 30.Amnesty said both the Bahraini and Kuwaiti apps can pair with a Bluetooth bracelet used to enforce quarantine measures by ensuring the user remains near their phone. The Kuwait app regularly checks the distance between the bracelet and the device, uploading location data every 10 minutes to a central server, the group said. In Bahrain, users registered for home quarantine who don’t wear the bracelet face fines or imprisonment, it added.Governments around the world have developed mobile apps to trace possible infections of the coronavirus, alerting users when they may have been near someone infectious. Authorities say the tools can help track and contain any resurgent outbreaks of the virus.But since their inception, contact-tracing apps have raised concerns about their potential to infringe on people’s rights to privacy by collecting sensitive data about location, health and information about who people interact with.Read more: Coronavirus Newsletter: Protecting Privacy in a PandemicAmnesty said it chose not to analyze apps that are based on a decentralized system, which is supported by a joint tool developed by Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. It said such apps, which store data on people’s phones instead of on government servers, tend to be less concerning from a privacy perspective.(Adds Bahrain’s comment starting in the sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.;Tue, 16 Jun 2020 15:27:07 +0000;AAPL_2020-06-16;0.946;0.0

0db60df0-6005-3065-b220-9f300408dd04;SHOP;Amazon Faces a Sharp Challenge From Walmart and Shopify;(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If you’re going to take on a giant like Amazon.com Inc., it helps to have partners. Shopify Inc. just got a big one.Walmart Inc. said on Monday that it has partnered with e-commerce store software company Shopify Inc., offering its third-party marketplace as a channel for the upstart’s merchant base. Walmart executive Jeff Clementz told Bloomberg News the retailer plans to add 1,200 Shopify sellers this year, citing recent positive results from a test trial. He also expects thousands of Shopify merchants to be integrated onto the retailer’s marketplace over time. The executive said it will focus on adding U.S.-based small and medium businesses with good records of customer satisfaction to its platform that can also complement its current product assortment. On Monday, Shopify’s stock rose 5%, while Walmart shares were roughly flat.The announcement adds another major player to Shopify’s growing alliance against Amazon.com Inc.’s e-commerce dominance. Last month, I wrote how Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke has often said his company’s goal was to “arm the rebels” against the Amazon empire. The Walmart deal comes just weeks after Shopify signed a partnership with Facebook Inc. that allows Shopify’s merchants to sell on the social-media giant’s platforms under the newly launched Facebook Shops initiative. Before these moves, the aggregated online sales of Shopify’s U.S. customer base already ranked as the second-largest in the country after Amazon, according to the company. And now with Walmart on board and the expanded deal with Facebook, they mark significant steps to expand Shopify’s eco-system, making its platform a more viable and an attractive alternative to sellers. The battle for e-commerce leadership is especially important given the industry’s soaring sales in the era of Covid-19. Last month, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said the trend toward e-commerce has been pulled forward by two years as consumers are preferring shopping online versus risking infection inside physical stores. Nowak predicts e-commerce penetration of U.S. retail sales will surge this year, rising to 23% versus 18% in 2019. In recent weeks, credit-card spending data for online shopping has stayed robust even as more states have re-opened their economies, pointing to a permanent shift of shopping behavior.The slew of Shopify partnerships may be coming at the right time for another reason as well: Amazon is increasingly getting scrutinized over its competitive practices. In April, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon employees used third-party seller data to develop its own competing products, actions the company has explicitly promised it wouldn’t do. And last week, Bloomberg News reported the European Union is preparing a formal complaint against Amazon, alleging the tech giant may be misusing data from third-party sellers on its platform.With more big players coalescing under Shopify’s banner, Amazon may finally be getting some serious competition in the e-commerce space. In turn, it will likely spur Amazon to do better, which is good news for all parties.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

(See his track record here.)""While it took a decade for digital commerce adoption to reach 15% in 2020 from 5% in 2010, there are early signals that CV-19 could drive a permanent structural industry change to consumer purchasing behavior in the post CV-19 era,"" the analyst said. Shopify has a ""critical footprint,"" since it already provides a retail operating system for more than 1 million merchants globally and is expanding its product offering, he said. The company could potentially grow its revenues fourfold to $12 billion by 2025, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 39%, Bracelin said. The analyst raised the revenue estimates for fiscal 2020 and 2021 from $2.21 billion to $2.25 billion and from $2.89 billion to $3.14 billion, respectively. He also raised earnings estimates from 35 cents per share to 43 cents per share in 2020 and from 47 cents per share to 57 cents per share in 2021.
